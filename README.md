# Waveshare-EInk

This is a business card template for the waveshare 298x128 tricolor e-paper.  In addition to installing the waveshare libraries on the Raspberry Pi (and prerequisite libraries), the following steps should be taken:

  1, upload an 84x69 bitmap image
  
  2, upload a 42x41 bitmap image
  
  3, ensure path references to images are correct
  
  4, python3 business_card.py
  
  5, adjust position and size of elements as necessary on successive executions
